Revision history for Perl extension Async::Interrupt.

1.26 Mon Apr 27 13:34:10 CEST 2020
	- make it compatible with perl 5.31's sighandler changes
          (patch by Todd Rinaldo).

1.25 Sat Apr 20 12:42:25 CEST 2019
	- fix dependency on Canary::Stability (reported by Ross Opperman).

1.24 Tue Apr 17 21:24:11 CEST 2018
	- actually rewnew was missing, not wrongly documented. silly.

1.23 Tue Apr 17 21:18:24 CEST 2018
	- ->renew is actually called ->post_fork, fix documentation.
        - use stability canary.

1.22 Thu Jan 18 17:43:14 CET 2018
	- further USE_SOCKETS_AS_HANDLES fixes (Z59).

1.21 Wed Feb 11 20:31:01 CET 2015
	- upgrade ecb.h for C11 compatibility.

1.2   Fri Apr 11 06:22:38 CEST 2014
	- perl5porters broke Async::Interrupt, BDB, EV, IO::AIO, OpenCL
          without warning by switching the meaning of USE_SOCKETS_AS_HANDLES
          in 5.18. What's so attractive about giving a shit about backwards
          compatibility - I will never understand.

1.1   Wed Apr 25 00:46:08 CEST 2012
	- new $async->handle method.
	- new $async->pipe_drain method.
        - use memory fences for !x86, and x86 future
          proofing. use libecb for implementation.

1.05  Sat May 15 02:06:33 CEST 2010
	- implement $epipe->signal_func method.

1.04  Wed Mar 31 02:46:49 CEST 2010
        - a double fork partially killed the event pipe (great testcase
          by dormando). affects IO::AIO, BDB and Async::Interrupt.

1.03  Tue Nov 24 14:31:10 CET 2009
	- port to loser platform.

1.02  Tue Sep  1 18:41:09 CEST 2009
	- prototypes for sig2name/sig2num were missing.

1.01  Wed Aug  5 13:50:59 CEST 2009
	- evpipe->wait did immediately return on !windows.

1.0   Thu Jul 30 05:58:55 CEST 2009
        - implement signal_hysteresis.
        - implement scope_block_func.
        - implement sig2name/sig2num convenience functions.

0.6   Sat Jul 18 07:09:33 CEST 2009
	- add autodrain setting.
        - added Async::Interrupt::EventPipe class.
        - fixed a potential race issue by removing the internal
          epipe state.
        - destroying asyncs inside their handler callback could lead
          to segfaults.
        - destroying an interrupt object did not properly remove it
          from the asyncs list (classical case of side-effect-inside-assert).

0.501 Fri Jul 17 16:58:51 CEST 2009
	- do no longer errornously do operations on fd 0 if no pipe
          is associated with the interrupt object.

0.5   Fri Jul 17 03:53:21 CEST 2009
	- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: signalling the value 0 is no longer allowed.
	- added automatic pipe creation code, including post_fork method.
        - added ->c_var method, and the ability to use a perl scalar as
          signal checker.

0.042 Tue Jul 14 21:51:04 CEST 2009
	- enforce initialisation of perl's signal handling framework,
          avoiding crashes otherwise.
	- switched to common::sense.
        - freely sprinkle around more volatiles.
        - fix initialisation code (XSLoader).
        - ported to win32.

0.041 Sun Jul 12 18:32:46 CEST 2009
        - oh my, I forgot to include the typemap.
	- improved documentation.

0.04  Sun Jul 12 00:24:02 CEST 2009
	- added ability to block the pipe write temporarily.
        - added the ability to call signal when the process receives
          a (POSIX) signal.
	- removed debugging output in constructor.
        - support eventfd instead of a pipe (untested).

0.03  Fri Jul  3 23:11:05 CEST 2009
	- port to perl <= 5.8.9.

0.02  Thu Jul  2 17:17:30 CEST 2009
	- first release, rather untested.

0.01  Thu Jul  2 13:18:00 CEST 2009
