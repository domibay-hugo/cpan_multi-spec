NAME
    Canary::Stability - canary to check perl compatibility for schmorp's
    modules

SYNOPSIS
     # in Makefile.PL
     use Canary::Stability DISTNAME => 2001, MINIMUM_PERL_VERSION;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is used by Schmorp's modules during configuration stage to
    test the installed perl for compatibility with his modules.

    It's not, at this stage, meant as a tool for other module authors,
    although in principle nothing prevents them from subscribing to the same
    ideas.

    See the Makefile.PL in Coro or AnyEvent for usage examples.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    "PERL_CANARY_STABILITY_NOPROMPT=1"
        Do not prompt the user on alert messages.

    "PERL_CANARY_STABILITY_COLOUR=0"
        Disable use of colour.

    "PERL_CANARY_STABILITY_COLOUR=1"
        Force use of colour.

    "PERL_CANARY_STABILITY_DISABLE=1"
        Disable this modules functionality completely.

    "AUTOMATED_TESTING=1"
        When this variable is set to a true value and the perl minimum
        version requirement is not met, the module will exit, which should
        skip testing under automated testing environments.

        This is done to avoid false failure or success reports when the
        chances of success are already quite low and the failures are not
        supported by the author.
